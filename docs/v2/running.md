# Running Onionbalance

!!! warning

    This section refers to the old v2 codebase, which was removed from recent
    releases.
    Although outdated, this documentation is still available for historic
    purposes.

## Description

You can start the Onionbalance management server once all of your
backend onion service instances are running.

You will need to create a
`configuration file <configuration_file_format>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} which list the backend onion services and the location of
your hidden service keys.

```console
$ onionbalance -c config.yaml
```

or

```console
$ sudo service onionbalance start
```

The management server must be left running to publish new descriptors
for your onion service: in about 10 minutes you should have a fully
functional onionbalance setup.

!!! note

    Multiple Onionbalance management servers can be run simultaneously with the
    same master private key and configuration file to provide redundancy.

## Configuration File Format {#configuration_file_format}

The Onionbalance management server is primarily configured using a YAML
configuration file ([example][]).

[example]: https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/onion-services/onionbalance/-/blob/main/onionbalance/config_generator/data/config.example.yaml

The `services` section of the configuration file contains a list of
master onion services that Onionbalance is responsible for.

Each `key` option specifies the location of the 1024 bit private RSA key
for the onion service. This master private key determines the address
that users will use to access your onion service. This private key
**must** be kept secure.

The location of the private key is evaluated as an absolute path, or
relative to the configuration file location.

You can use existing Tor onion service private key with Onionbalance to
keep your onion address.

Each backend Tor onion service instance is listed by its unique onion
address in the `instances` list.

!!! note

    You can replace backend instance keys if they get lost or compromised.
    Simply start a new backend onion service under a new key and replace the
    `address` in the config file.

If you have used the [configuration tool](../config.md) you can
simply use the generated config file from `master/config.yaml`.

!!! note

    By default onionbalance will search for a `config.yaml` file in the current
    working directory.

### Configuration Options

The Onionbalance command line options can also be specified in the
Onionbalance configuration file. Options specified on the command line
take precedence over the related configuration file options:

* `TOR_CONTROL_SOCKET`: The location of the Tor unix domain control socket.
  Onionbalance will attempt to connect to this control socket first before
  falling back to using a control port connection. (default:
  `/var/run/tor/control`)

* `TOR_ADDRESS`: The address where the Tor control port is listening. (default:
  `127.0.0.1`).

* `TOR_PORT`: The Tor control port. (default: `9051`)

* `TOR_CONTROL_PASSWORD`: The password for authenticating to a Tor control port
  which is using the HashedControlPassword authentication method. This is not
  needed when the Tor control port is using the more common
  CookieAuthentication method. (default: `None`)

Other options:

* `LOG_LOCATION`: The path where Onionbalance should write its log file.

* `LOG_LEVEL`: Specify the minimum verbosity of log messages to output. All log
  messages equal or higher the the specified log level are output. The
  available log levels are the same as the `--verbosity` command line option.

* `REFRESH_INTERVAL`: How often to check for updated backend onion service
  descriptors.  This value can be decreased if your backend instance are under
  heavy loaded causing them to rotate introduction points quickly. (default:
  `600` seconds).

* `PUBLISH_CHECK_INTERVAL`: How often should to check if new descriptors need
  to be published for the master onion service (default: `360` seconds).

* `INITIAL_DELAY`: How long to wait between starting Onionbalance and
  publishing the master descriptor. If you have more than 20 backend instances
  you may need to wait longer for all instance descriptors to download before
  starting (default: `45` seconds).

* `DISTINCT_DESCRIPTORS`: Distinct descriptors are used if you have more than
  10 backend instances. At the cost of scalability, this can be disabled to
  appear more like a standard onion service. (default: `True`)

* `STATUS_SOCKET_LOCATION`: The Onionbalance service creates a Unix domain
  socket which provides real-time information about the currently loaded
  service and descriptors. This option can be used to change the location of
  this domain socket. (default: `/var/run/onionbalance/control`)

The following options typically do not need to be modified by the end
user:

* `REPLICAS`: How many set of HSDirs to upload too (default: `2`).

* `MAX_INTRO_POINTS`: How many introduction points to include in a descriptor
  (default: `10`).

* `DESCRIPTOR_VALIDITY_PERIOD`: How long a onion service descriptor remains
  valid (default: `86400` seconds).

* `DESCRIPTOR_OVERLAP_PERIOD`: How long to overlap onion service descriptors
  when changing descriptor IDs (default: `3600` seconds).

* `DESCRIPTOR_UPLOAD_PERIOD`: How often to publish a descriptor, even when the
  introduction points don't change (default: `3600` seconds).

### Environment Variables

* `ONIONBALANCE_CONFIG`: Override the location for the Onionbalance
  configuration file. The loaded configuration file takes precedence over
  environment variables. Configuration file options will override environment
  variable which have the same name.

* `ONIONBALANCE_LOG_LOCATION`: See the config file option.

* `ONIONBALANCE_LOG_LEVEL`: See the config file option.

* `ONIONBALANCE_STATUS_SOCKET_LOCATION`: See the config file option.

* `ONIONBALANCE_TOR_CONTROL_SOCKET`: See the config file option.

## Files

* `/etc/onionbalance/config.yaml`: The configuration file, which contains
  `services` entries.

* `./config.yaml`: Fallback location for torrc, if
  `/etc/onionbalance/config.yaml` is not found.
