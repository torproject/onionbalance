# Installing Onionbalance

!!! warning

    This section refers to the old v2 codebase, which was removed from recent
    releases.
    Although outdated, this documentation is still available for historic
    purposes.

Onionbalance requires at least one system that is running the
Onionbalance management server.

The Onionbalance software does not need to be installed on the backend
servers which provide the onion service content (i.e. web site, IRC
server etc.).

Onionbalance is not yet packaged for most Linux and BSD. The tool can be
installed from PyPI or directly from the Git repository:

```console
# pip install onionbalance
```

or

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/asn-d6/onionbalance.git
$ cd onionbalance
# python setup.py install
```

If you are running Debian Jessie (with backports enabled) or later you
can install Onionbalance with the following command:

```console
# apt-get install onionbalance
```

There is also a python 3 based package available in Fedora \>= 25:

```console
# yum install python3-onionbalance
```

For CentOS or RedHat 7 there is a python 2 based package available in
the EPEL Repository:

```console
# yum install python2-onionbalance
```

All tagged releases on Github or PyPi are signed with my GPG key:
