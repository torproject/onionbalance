# NAME

onionbalance-config - tool for generating onionbalance(1) config files and keys

# SYNOPSIS

{usage}

# DESCRIPTION

The onionbalance-config tool is the fastest way to generate the necessary keys
and config files to get your onion service up and running.

# FULL INVOCATION

{invocation}

When called without any arguments, the config generator will run in an
interactive mode and prompt for user input.

# CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

This is a sample configuration file that can be adapted:

{config}

# FILES

The main configuration folder should be stored on the management server while
the other, backend instance data should be hosted in the respective backend
servers, as usual.

Default configuration file locations when running Onionbalance as a local, user
service (which can be customized through the --output option when invoking
onionbalance-config):

config/config.yaml
:  This is the configuration file that is used by the Onionbalance management
   server.

config/ONION_ADDRESS.key
:  Each service instance have a private key, which will be derived into the
   public address and identity for the Onion Service.
   Each private key file is named after the .onion address, so
   ONION_ADDRESS.key will be actually like
   dpkhemrbs3oiv2fww5sxs6r2uybczwijzfn2ezy2osaj7iox7kl7nhad.key.
   It is essential that you keep these files secure.

System-wide files, when running Onionbalance as a system service:

/etc/onionbalance/config.yaml
:  The global configuration file, which contains services entries.

/etc/onionbalance/ONION_ADDRESS.key
:  Service instance private key file.
   Each private key file is named after the .onion address, so
   ONION_ADDRESS.key will be actually like
   dpkhemrbs3oiv2fww5sxs6r2uybczwijzfn2ezy2osaj7iox7kl7nhad.key.
   It is essential that you keep these files secure.
