# NAME

onionbalance-config - tool for generating onionbalance(1) config files and keys

# SYNOPSIS

{usage}

# DESCRIPTION

The onionbalance-config tool is the fastest way to generate the necessary keys
and config files to get your onion service up and running.

# FULL INVOCATION

{invocation}

When called without any arguments, the config generator will run in an
interactive mode and prompt for user input.

The main directory should be stored on the management server while the other
instance directories should be transferred to the respective backend servers.

# CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

This is a sample configuration file that can be adapted:

{config}

# FILES

master/config.yaml
:  This is the configuration file that is used my the Onionbalance management
   server.

master/<ONION_ADDRESS>.key
:  The private key which will become the public address and identity for your
   onion service. It is essential that you keep this key secure.

master/torrc-server
:  A sample Tor configuration file which can be used with the Tor instance
   running on the management server (v2-only).

srv/torrc-instance
:  A sample Tor config file which contains the Tor Onion Service options
   needed for your backend Tor instance (v2-only).

srv/<ONION_ADDRESS>/private_key
:  Directory containing the private key for your backend onion service
   instance.  This key is less critical as it can be rotated if lost or
   compromised (v2-only).

# EXIT STATUS

onionbalance-config exits with a non-zero status in case of errors.

Exit status is 2 on command line invocation errors.

For other, general errors, the exit status is 1.
