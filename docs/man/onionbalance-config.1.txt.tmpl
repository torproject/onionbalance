# NAME

onionbalance-config - tool for generating onionbalance(1) config files and keys

# SYNOPSIS

{usage}

# DESCRIPTION

The onionbalance-config tool is the fastest way to generate the necessary keys
and config files to get your onion service up and running.

# FULL INVOCATION

{invocation}

When called without any arguments, the config generator will run in an
interactive mode and prompt for user input.

# CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

This is a sample configuration file that can be adapted:

{config}

# FILES

Onionbalance requires the following files:

config.yaml
:  This is the configuration file that is used by the Onionbalance management
   server.
   The exact location can be specified by invoking onionbalance with the
   -c option.

ONION_ADDRESS.key
:  Each service instance have a private key, which will be derived into the
   public address and identity for the Onion Service.
   Each private key file is named after the .onion address, so
   ONION_ADDRESS.key will be actually like
   dpkhemrbs3oiv2fww5sxs6r2uybczwijzfn2ezy2osaj7iox7kl7nhad.key.
   It is essential that you keep these files secure.

By default, onionbalance-config writes these files in the config/ folder,
relative to the folder where it was invoked from.

The actual folder can be explicitly set by invoking onionbalance-config with the
--output flag.

To configure the system-wide service, onionbalance-config should set --output
to /etc/onionbalance.

# EXIT STATUS

onionbalance-config exits with a non-zero status in case of errors.

Exit status is 2 on command line invocation errors.

For other, general errors, the exit status is 1.

Otherwise, the exit status is 0.
