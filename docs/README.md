# Onionbalance

## Overview

[Onionbalance][] is the best way to load balance onion services across
multiple backend Tor instances. This way the load of introduction and
rendezvous requests get distributed across multiple hosts. Onionbalance
provides load-balancing while also making onion services more resilient
and reliable by eliminating single points-of-failure.
