# Onionbalance contributors

Onionbalance (OB) was invented by Donncha during a GSoC many moons ago. Back
then OB only supported [v2][] Onion Services. When [v3] onions appeared, the Tor
network team took over to [add v3
support](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/26768).

[v3]: https://spec.torproject.org/rend-spec-v3
[v2]: https://spec.torproject.org/rend-spec-v2
